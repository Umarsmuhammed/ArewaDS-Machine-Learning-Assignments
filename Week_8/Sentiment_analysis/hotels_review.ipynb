    "# Introduction\n",
    "So far we've learned about how text data is quite unlike numerical types of data. If it's text that was written or spoken by a human, if can be analysed to find patterns and frequencies, sentiment and meaning. This lesson takes you into a real data set with a real challenge: [515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe) and includes a [CC0: Public Domain license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). It was scraped from Booking.com from public sources. The creator of the dataset was Jiashen Liu"
