# Answer
I decided to find a bot in a banking application and on the phone and adopt it for my research. I chose a banking and loan application chatbot that helps customers with their banking and loan application process. I interacted with the chatbot through text-based chats on the bank's website and asked it various questions about the loan products, eligibility criteria, interest rates, and required documents. The chatbot was able to provide me with relevant information and guide me through the application process. It also offered me a link to schedule a call with a human agent if I needed more assistance.

I tried to confuse the chatbot by asking it unrelated questions, such as what is its favorite color, how old is it, and what is the meaning of life. The chatbot responded by saying that it did not understand my question and asked me to rephrase it or choose from a list of predefined topics. It also reminded me of the purpose of the chatbot and suggested me to contact a human agent if I had any non-banking related queries.

I think the chatbot was able to handle my attempts to confuse it well because it was designed with natural language processing and machine learning capabilities that enabled it to recognize the intent and context of my questions and provide appropriate responses. It also had a fallback mechanism that directed me to other channels of communication if it could not answer my question. The chatbot was not perfect, however, as it sometimes repeated itself or gave vague answers that did not fully address my concerns.

In conclusion, I found the experience of using a banking and loan application chatbot interesting and informative. I learned about the different loan products and how to apply for them online. I also observed how the chatbot interacted with me and how it handled my attempts to confuse it. I think chatbots are useful tools for banks to provide faster and more convenient service to their customers, but they also need to be constantly improved and updated to meet the changing needs and expectations of the users.
