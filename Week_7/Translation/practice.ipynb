    "## Translation\n",
    "A naive translation program might translate words only, ignoring the sentence structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ If you've learned a second (or third or more) language as an adult, you might have started by thinking in your native language, translating a concept word by word in your head to the second language, and then speaking out your translation. This is similar to what naive translation computer programs are doing. It's important to get past this phase to attain fluency!\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive translation leads to bad (and sometimes hilarious) mistranslations: I feel happy translates literally to Mise bhraitheann athas in Irish. That means (literally) me feel happy and is not a valid Irish sentence. Even though English and Irish are languages spoken on two closely neighboring islands, they are very different languages with different grammar structures."

    "# Machine learning approaches\n",
    "So far, you've learned about the formal rules approach to natural language processing. Another approach is to ignore the meaning of the words, and instead use machine learning to detect patterns. This can work in translation if you have lots of text (a corpus) or texts (corpora) in both the origin and target languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the case of Pride and Prejudice, a well-known English novel written by Jane Austen in 1813. If you consult the book in English and a human translation of the book in French, you could detect phrases in one that are idiomatically translated into the other. You'll do that in a minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when an English phrase such as I have no money is translated literally to French, it might become Je n'ai pas de monnaie. \"Monnaie\" is a tricky french 'false cognate', as 'money' and 'monnaie' are not synonymous. A better translation that a human might make would be Je n'ai pas d'argent, because it better conveys the meaning that you have no money (rather than 'loose change' which is the meaning of 'monnaie')\n",
    "\n",
    "If an ML model has enough human translations to build a model on, it can improve the accuracy of translations by identifying common patterns in texts that have been previously translated by expert human speakers of both languages.\n",
    "\n",

    "\"C'est une vérité universelle qu'un célibataire pourvu d'une belle fortune doit avoir envie de se marier, et, si peu que l'on sache de son sentiment à cet egard, lorsqu'il arrive dans une nouvelle résidence, cette idée est si bien fixée dans l'esprit de ses voisins qu'ils le considèrent sur-le-champ comme la propriété légitime de l'une ou l'autre de leurs filles.\"\n",

    "What's going on here? and why is TextBlob so good at translation? Well, behind the scenes, it's using Google translate, a sophisticated AI able to parse millions of phrases to predict the best strings for the task at hand. There's nothing manual going on here and you need an internet connection to use blob.translate.\n",

    "# Sentiment analysis\n",
    "Another area where machine learning can work very well is sentiment analysis. A non-ML approach to sentiment is to identify words and phrases which are 'positive' and 'negative'. Then, given a new piece of text, calculate the total value of the positive, negative and neutral words to identify the overall sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is easily tricked as you may have seen in the Marvin task - the sentence Great, that was a wonderful waste of time, I'm glad we are lost on this dark road is a sarcastic, negative sentiment sentence, but the simple algorithm detects 'great', 'wonderful', 'glad' as positive and 'waste', 'lost' and 'dark' as negative. The overall sentiment is swayed by these conflicting words.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Stop a second and think about how we convey sarcasm as human speakers. Tone inflection plays a large role. Try to say the phrase \"Well, that film was awesome\" in different ways to discover how your voice conveys meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ML approaches\n",
    "The ML approach would be to manually gather negative and positive bodies of text - tweets, or movie reviews, or anything where the human has given a score and a written opinion. Then NLP techniques can be applied to opinions and scores, so that patterns emerge (e.g., positive movie reviews tend to have the phrase 'Oscar worthy' more than negative movie reviews, or positive restaurant reviews say 'gourmet' much more than 'disgusting').\n",
    "\n",
    "⚖️ Example: If you worked in a politician's office and there was some new law being debated, constituents might write to the office with emails supporting or emails against the particular new law. Let's say you are tasked with reading the emails and sorting them in 2 piles, for and against. If there were a lot of emails, you might be overwhelmed attempting to read them all. Wouldn't it be nice if a bot could read them all for you, understand them and tell you in which pile each email belonged?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to achieve that is to use Machine Learning. You would train the model with a portion of the against emails and a portion of the for emails. The model would tend to associate phrases and words with the against side and the for side, but it would not understand any of the content, only that certain words and patterns were more likely to appear in an against or a for email. You could test it with some emails that you had not used to train the model, and see if it came to the same conclusion as you did. Then, once you were happy with the accuracy of the model, you could process future emails without having to read each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Does this process sound like processes you have used in previous lessons?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise - sentimental sentences\n",
    "Sentiment is measured in with a polarity of -1 to 1, meaning -1 is the most negative sentiment, and 1 is the most positive. Sentiment is also measured with an 0 - 1 score for objectivity (0) and subjectivity (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take another look at Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The text is available here at Project Gutenberg. The sample below shows a short program which analyses the sentiment of first and last sentences from the book and display its sentiment polarity and subjectivity/objectivity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the TextBlob library (described above) to determine sentiment (you do not have to write your own sentiment calculator) in the following task."
